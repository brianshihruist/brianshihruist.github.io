title: About
---

My name is Brian, current an engineer at Airkit. At Airkit, we are building a runtime for CX (Customer experience). 

My current engineering interests are PL and distributed systems. In the PL land, I am primarily interested in functional programming and type theory.
I am still really new to both fields so I am exploring ways to dive deeper into them.
